# SpeedyF

Author: Adam Nissen
Note: Made using google gemini 2.5

## Project Goal

SpeedyF aims to provide a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for designing custom PDF filling applications. Users can upload PDF documents, visually define areas for data entry (custom text, pre-defined options, drawings, initials, signatures), and set simple conditional rules. SpeedyF then exports a lightweight, standalone program that end-users (e.g., sales staff, realtors) can use to quickly and efficiently fill out these PDFs.

## Core Features

### 1. SpeedyF Designer Application (The "Suite")

* **PDF Upload & Display:** Load and view multi-page PDF documents.
* **Visual Field Definition:**
    * Draw boxes directly on the PDF preview to define fillable areas.
    * Supported field types:
        * **Text Input:** Standard text entry.
        * **Signature/Initial Boxes:** Capture mouse/touchpad drawn signatures or initials.
        * **Static Pre-defined Text:** Text that is automatically placed (e.g., company address).
        * **User-Selected Pre-defined Text:** Create dropdown lists for end-users.
        * **Simple Drawings:** Add visual cues like circles, ovals, lines, or "X" markers to highlight or block sections.
* **Field Properties:** Assign prompts, names, and other properties to each defined area.
* **Simple Rule Engine (Planned for v1.x):** Define basic conditional logic (e.g., show/hide fields or apply highlights based on a user-defined variable like "Client Type").
* **Project Management:** Save and load SpeedyF templates.
* **Export Filler Program:** Package the original PDF(s), field definitions, and rules into a simple, standalone executable for end-users.

### 2. Exported SpeedyF Filler Program (The "End-User App")

* **Lightweight & Simple UI:** Designed for users with minimal technical expertise.
* **Guided Data Entry:** Presents clear prompts for each field one by one.
    * Handles text input, signature/initial drawing, and dropdown selections.
* **Rule Execution:** Applies any defined conditional logic to show relevant fields or highlights.
* **PDF Generation:** Creates a new PDF with all the entered information accurately placed.
* **Cross-Platform:** Designed to run on Windows and macOS.

## Current Status

* **Version:** In Development (Pre-Alpha / v0.x.x)
* *This section will be updated as SpeedyF progresses.*

## Technology Stack

* **Core Language:** Python 3.x
* **SpeedyF Designer Application UI:** PyQt6 (or PySide6)
* **Exported SpeedyF Filler Program UI:** Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
* **PDF Manipulation:** PyMuPDF (fitz)
* **Image Handling (for signatures):** Pillow (PIL Fork)
* **Packaging:** PyInstaller (for creating executables)

## Getting Started (For Developers)

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* `venv` (recommended for virtual environments)
* Git

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd speedyf
    ```

2.  **Set up the SpeedyF Designer Application environment:**
    ```bash
    cd designer_app
    python -m venv venv_designer
    # On Windows
    .\venv_designer\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv_designer/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_designer.txt
    cd ..
    ```
    *(Note: `requirements_designer.txt` will need to be created and list PyQt6/PySide6, PyMuPDF, etc.)*

3.  **Set up the Exported SpeedyF Program Template environment:**
    ```bash
    cd exported_program_template
    python -m venv venv_filler
    # On Windows
    .\venv_filler\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv_filler/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_filler.txt
    cd ..
    ```
    *(Note: `requirements_filler.txt` will need to be created and list PyMuPDF, Pillow, etc. Tkinter is standard.)*

### Running the Applications

* **SpeedyF Designer Application (from source):**
    ```bash
    cd designer_app
    # Activate venv_designer if not already active
    python src/main_designer.py
    ```

* **Exported SpeedyF Filler Program:**
    This program is generated by the SpeedyF Designer Application. Once exported, it will be a standalone executable that end-users can run directly. Developers can test the template logic by running:
    ```bash
    cd exported_program_template
    # Activate venv_filler if not already active
    # You'll need a sample config.json and PDF to test it directly
    python src/main_filler.py path/to/config.json
    ```

## Development Workflow

SpeedyF follows an iterative development workflow:
1.  **Foundation & Setup:** Initial project, Git, environments.
2.  **Core PDF Viewing & Area Definition (Designer):** Basic PDF loading and field drawing.
3.  **Basic Exported Filler & PDF Generation:** First end-to-end version with text input.
4.  **Expanding Field Types:** Adding signatures, drawings, predefined text.
5.  **Rule Engine Implementation:** Adding conditional logic.
6.  **UI/UX Refinement & Error Handling.**
7.  **Testing:** Unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
8.  **Documentation.**
9.  **Packaging & Distribution.**

Cross-cutting concerns include consistent version control, issue tracking, and regular cross-platform testing.

## Future Enhancements (Post v1.x for SpeedyF)

* **Advanced Sanity Checker:** Verify PDF layout integrity before filling.
* **More Complex Rule Engine:** Support for more intricate conditions and actions.
* **Data Import/Scraping:** Populate fields from external sources like spreadsheets or web forms.
* **True Digital Signature Field Support:** Interact with existing digital signature fields or create new ones (a significant undertaking).
* **Cloud Integration/Collaboration Features.**
